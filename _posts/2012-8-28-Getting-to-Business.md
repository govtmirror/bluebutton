The 18 PIFs are spread across 9 agencies within the Federal Governent. The Innovation Lab at OPM is our weekly gathering spot. The lab is a shared working space where the initiatives can hold meetings, conduct workshops, and collaborate on solutions.

In this shot you can see Claudia Williams (Senior Advisor at the White House) and Matt McCall (PIF) working together. In background you've got the Open Data Initiative, Todd Park (White House CTO), and Ari Astles.
