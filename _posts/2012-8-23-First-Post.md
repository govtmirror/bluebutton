Today, the White House launched the Presidential Innovations Fellows Program (PIF), which pairs top innovators from the private sector, non-profits and academia with top innovators in government to collaborate on solutions that aim to deliver significant results in six months. The Department of Health and Human Services and the Department of Veterans Affairs is proud to have the Blue Button initiative as one of the pillars of the Presidential Innovation Fellows Program.

Blue Button will expand the ability for millions of Americans to easily and securely download their own health information electronically, while fueling a new marketplace in useful health-related apps, products, and services
