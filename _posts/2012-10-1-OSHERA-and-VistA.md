According to the oral history of the Department of Veterans Affairs, of which I have been an attentive listener over the years, once upon a time, innovation ruled the land.  VistA, the legendary Electronic Health Record, was born in the basements of VA medical centers, and raised like a child by doting clinicians and wise developers.  VistA grew and grew into the king it was destined to become, and was loved by all as a fair and friendly lord.

However, a cold wind began blowing from the lands in the north, and it grew clear to VA: winter was coming.

Over time innovation slowed, and VA began seriously weighing the purchase of a commercial solution.  The vendor community had been rapidly creating new features, and closing in on the widely deployed VistA solution.  VA faced a decision, either find a way to drive innovation now so VistA can remain arguably the most powerful EHR in the world, or undertake a massive project to implement a proprietary solution.  Their answer was simple: lets try open source.

Thus the VA launched a project to establish a 'custodial agent,' essentially relinquishing VistA to a newly created organization to make it freely available and act as a crucible for enhancements by all community members.  This organization, known to today as OSEHRA, has to date enrolled over 1,400 individual members, and is a rapidly growing ecosystem of applications across the Health IT space.

Today, VA is undertaking ambitious projects such as code convergence, wherein new tools and processes are being built to analyze variations between the 120+ distinct installations of VistA in order to identify and implement the best features system-wide.  In this, VA is literally driving operational and programmatic best practices in healthcare.  They are baking open source it into their culture, and every day finding new opportunities for rapid innovation across projects.

The idea of tying Blue Button enhancements into OSEHRA is one which personally excites me.  By building a 'Blue Button Platform' in open source, VA can collaborate with the community on shaping an implementation of what this project can achieve transparently, securely, and cost effectively.  Through open source, anyone who touches healthcare may contribute; which is everyone.  By then implementing this within VA, real impact can be achieved for our veterans.  It excites me as a technologist, a taxpayer, a citizen, and most of all, as a patient.
